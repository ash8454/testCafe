# AP2 Automation Framework

AP2 Automation Framework uses TestCafe Framework written in JS which uses WebProxy instead of WebDriver to run the tests as well as the Cucumber Framework
which uses ATDD Agile Principle to run the tests based on the business functionality.

Since the TestCafe doesn't officially support Cucumber, "gherkin-testcafe" Framework is used to support Cucumber while using the regular Test Cafe features.

If you want to learn more about TestCafe, please follow this link: https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/.
